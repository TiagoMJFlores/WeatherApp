# WeatherApp

**UI**
I implemented the app using the interface builder as requested. I turned the cells into xibs so they can be reused.
My intention was to include the xibs as @IBDesignable(s) in the Storyboard but I didn't have enough time.

**Arquitecture**
I used MVP

**Unit Tests**
I used Quick and Nimble.
